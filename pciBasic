PCI basic

PCI devices have a set of registers referred to as ‘Configuration Space’ 
PCI Express introduces Extended Configuration Space for devices. 

Configuration space registers are mapped to memory locations.

Device drivers and diagnostic software must access the configuration spaces and
operating systems have APIs to allow access to device configuration space
